# RSSDK addon for openframeworks 0.8.4 with support for F200 and R200

__Under Construction__

Currently supported:
* RGB Streaming
* Depth Streaming (Raw Depth and Depth as Color)
* Point Cloud

If you've come here from the previous version, you'll notice the interface has completely changed, but hopefully it's still fairly easy to understand. Thanks everyone for your patience and please feel free to continue sending me feature requests, I don't get to everything right away as you can tell, but it definitely helps me prioritize. Cheers! -Seth
